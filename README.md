Project Description :
The *Pothole Reporting & Road Safety System* allows users to report potholes, road breaks, and other hazards with images, severity levels, and descriptions. The reports are displayed on an interactive OpenStreetMap for easy visibility and monitoring.

---

The Problem Statement: 
Driving on damaged roads can be dangerous, but there's no simple way to report or track road issues in real-time. Weâ€™re tackling this problem by creating a platform where users can easily report road hazards.

---

The Solution:
This platform enables users to submit reports with images and details, view road hazards on an interactive map, and track the status of reported issues until they are resolved. By crowdsourcing data, we aim to improve road safety and infrastructure management.
